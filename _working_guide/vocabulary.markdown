- octet streams
  In computing, an octet is a grouping of eight bits. The term is often used where the term byte might be ambiguous. For that reason, computer networking standards almost exclusively use octet. It is prominently used in the Request for Comments (RFC) publications of the Internet Engineering Task Force. The earliest example is RFC 635 from 1974. In France, French Canada and Romania, the word octet is used in common language instead of byte (in the 8-bit sense); a megabyte (MB) is called a megaoctet (Mo). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octet_(computing)
  In computer science, a byte stream is a bit stream, in which data bits are grouped into units, called bytes. In computer networking the term octet stream is sometimes used to refer to the same thing; it emphasizes the use of bytes having the length of 8 bits, known as octets. The size of a byte was not standard when the term was introduced, whereas on most modern computers byte is a synonym of octet. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_stream
